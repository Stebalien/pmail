    // We use four (or more) separate threads for our communication.
    // This has three major benefits (in order of importance):
    //
    // 1. Preventing information leaks.  We leverage rust's memory
    //    safety to ensure that "secret" information cannot be leaked
    //    to code that should not know about it.  We may want to
    //    enable further separation one day by changing these to
    //    processes and perhaps dropping privileges with seccomp.
    //    Note: rust could actually acheive this without using OS
    //    threads, but using threads makes it harder to break this
    //    barrier accidentally.
    //
    // 2. Avoiding timing leaks.  Because the threads run as separate
    //    OS threads, it is unlikely that the time spent on one of
    //    these tasks will be observable in the behavior of another
    //    one.  Rust does not give us a strong guarantee here, so we
    //    also need to be careful, e.g. by either pacing the sending
    //    of datagrams, or sending them prior to examination of secret
    //    content.
    //
    // 3. Parallelization. Different tasks can run on different cores.
    //    Note that this is the *least* important reason for us to use
    //    threads.

    // We use two threads for sending and receiving respectively, in
    // an attempt to minimize the opportunity for timing attacks.  On
    // top of this, the sender always sends on a regular schedule,
    // which further decreases the opportunity for timing attacks.
    // Actually, the receiver also sends confirmation datagrams, but
    // prior to decrypting or reading any "secret" output.
